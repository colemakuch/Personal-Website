      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>I play guitar and bass in a number of groups on campus. I'm currently the house guitarist for the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WUKidsOnCampus/">Kids on Campus</a> sketch comedy
        group at WashU (live recording below), and play bass and guitar for another student band: Doug Addicts (future releases in the works).

<<<<<<< HEAD
      <p>I'm currently in the process of recording a solo album. I plan to periodically release new material on my <a href="https://colemakuch.bandcamp.com/releases">Bandcamp</a>,
        so check back to stay in the loop with new material.
=======
      <p>I also record and release work as a solo artist, and plan to release an album in the coming months. I currently have a working repository published on my <a href="https://colemakuch.bandcamp.com/releases">Bandcamp</a>,
        which serves as my musical 'resume' so-to-speak.
